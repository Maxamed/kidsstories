                    <p class="story-preview-content-text">Mark was a cheerful 6-year-old boy who loved exploring. Every day after school, he imagined himself as a brave knight or a daring adventurer in his backyard. One sunny afternoon, while playing, he heard a faint meowing sound. Following the sound, Mark found a tiny kitten stuck high up in a tree. The kitten was scared and couldnâ€™t climb down.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-preview-content-text">Mark wanted to help, but the tree was tall, and he felt afraid. For a moment, he thought about calling his parents, but then he remembered what his dad always said: "Being brave means facing your fears to help others." Mark took a deep breath, determined to save the kitten.
